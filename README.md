# Are you drinking enough water?
Water Watch is a website designed to make tracking your daily water intake visually appealing and straightforward. Visualizing the recommended amount of water can be challenging with just numbers and measurements. Instead, Water Watch simplifies this by allowing users to track their intake using familiar containers, such as cups or water bottles. Users can easily drag and drop to indicate how much they've consumed and be shown in a friendly manner how much left they should consume.

## Project Documentation
Before starting this project and along the way, I'll be planning how I envision the product to turn out.

### Product Documentation
Functional Requirements: 
    - Users can drag and drop various containers of water to represent their daily intake
    - Users will be returned a few different ways they can consume water to meet the daily average
    - Users can input when they woke up, their age, gender, weight, etc to calculate their daily average and when they need 
    to finish by

Non-Functional Requirements:
    - Information is cached so if someone revisits, how much water they drank earlier is saved

User Scenarios/Target Audience:
    - Someone quickly wants to check if they drank enough water today, espically since they didn't measure but drank out of various containers (cups, plastic water bottles, resuable water bottles, other beverages). They can go to the website and choose from the many containers to get an estimate of how much water they drank. Afterwards, they will be shown how much water they have left drink and all the ways they can do that.
    - Target audience is someone who uses technology regularly (ages 18-30) and are in a fast paced environment where their means of water intake can differ day by day

### Process Documentation
Technology:
    - Frontend: React, TailwindCSS, daisyUI
    - Backend: Node.js
    - DevOps: GitHub Actions, Docker, Jest
    - Deployment: TBD
